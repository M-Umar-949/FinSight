0	4120	What is the stock exchange and how does it work?
4120	7040	The stock exchange is a global marketplace.
7040	11600	When companies decide to go public, they divide the company into shares which are floated
11600	17660	on the stock exchange, i.e. made available on the stock exchange to buy and sell.
17660	23160	People who purchase shares of the company become shareholders and own part of the company.
23160	27600	Shareholders, unless they own a significant percentage of the company's shares, are unlikely
27600	31400	to have any direct say on how the company is run.
31400	35640	But they will be able to attend shareholder meetings where the bosses of the company will
35640	39440	present their strategies and plans for the company going forward.
39440	43760	These meetings are also a place where the bosses are answerable to the shareholders for bad
43760	46720	decisions and poor company performance.
46720	51260	Depending on the perceived value of a company, the price of a share will rise or fall.
51260	56840	If say company X has landed a lucrative government contract, then confidence in company X will
56840	60480	rise and the company's share price is likely to rise.
60480	65240	On the other hand, if company Y suffers a setback during the manufacturing of its product,
65240	70920	confidence in company Y is likely to fall and the company's share price will also fall.
70920	76120	The value of shares fluctuate daily and stockbrokers work the market for their clients, trying
76120	80000	to make a profit for them by buying shares when the prices are low and selling shares
80000	82280	when the prices are high.
82280	87320	In relation to the stock market, you may have heard acronyms and terms used such as FTSE,
87320	91200	NASDAQ, Dow Jones, S&P 500, etc.
91200	95240	These are the names of share indexes and they measure the value of a section of the stock
95240	96240	market.
96240	102340	For example, in the UK, the FTSE 100 is a share index composed of the 100 largest companies
102340	104920	listed on the London Stock Exchange.
104920	109480	These companies are often dubbed blue chip companies and include companies such as Barclay's
109480	112120	EasyJet, Tesco and ITV.
112120	117040	The value of this share index is an indicator of how well the UK's economy is doing as
117040	118040	a whole.
118040	120760	So, that's the stock exchange in a nutshell.
120760	125120	It's a global marketplace where shares and other company securities such as bonds are
125120	126640	bought and sold.
126640	130940	This is obviously a simplified explanation but it should give you a basic understanding
130940	134000	of what the stock exchange is and how it works.
