00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,120
What is the stock exchange and how does it work?

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,040
The stock exchange is a global marketplace.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,600
When companies decide to go public, they divide the company into shares which are floated

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:17,660
on the stock exchange, i.e. made available on the stock exchange to buy and sell.

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:23,160
People who purchase shares of the company become shareholders and own part of the company.

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,600
Shareholders, unless they own a significant percentage of the company's shares, are unlikely

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,400
to have any direct say on how the company is run.

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,640
But they will be able to attend shareholder meetings where the bosses of the company will

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,440
present their strategies and plans for the company going forward.

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,760
These meetings are also a place where the bosses are answerable to the shareholders for bad

11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,720
decisions and poor company performance.

12
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,260
Depending on the perceived value of a company, the price of a share will rise or fall.

13
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:56,840
If say company X has landed a lucrative government contract, then confidence in company X will

14
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,480
rise and the company's share price is likely to rise.

15
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,240
On the other hand, if company Y suffers a setback during the manufacturing of its product,

16
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:10,920
confidence in company Y is likely to fall and the company's share price will also fall.

17
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,120
The value of shares fluctuate daily and stockbrokers work the market for their clients, trying

18
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,000
to make a profit for them by buying shares when the prices are low and selling shares

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,280
when the prices are high.

20
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,320
In relation to the stock market, you may have heard acronyms and terms used such as FTSE,

21
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,200
NASDAQ, Dow Jones, S&P 500, etc.

22
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,240
These are the names of share indexes and they measure the value of a section of the stock

23
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,240
market.

24
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,340
For example, in the UK, the FTSE 100 is a share index composed of the 100 largest companies

25
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,920
listed on the London Stock Exchange.

26
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,480
These companies are often dubbed blue chip companies and include companies such as Barclay's

27
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,120
EasyJet, Tesco and ITV.

28
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:57,040
The value of this share index is an indicator of how well the UK's economy is doing as

29
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,040
a whole.

30
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,760
So, that's the stock exchange in a nutshell.

31
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:05,120
It's a global marketplace where shares and other company securities such as bonds are

32
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,640
bought and sold.

33
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,940
This is obviously a simplified explanation but it should give you a basic understanding

34
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:14,000
of what the stock exchange is and how it works.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,120
