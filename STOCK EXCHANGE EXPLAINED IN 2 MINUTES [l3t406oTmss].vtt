What is the stock exchange and how does it work?

00:04.120 --> 00:07.040
The stock exchange is a global marketplace.

00:07.040 --> 00:11.600
When companies decide to go public, they divide the company into shares which are floated

00:11.600 --> 00:17.660
on the stock exchange, i.e. made available on the stock exchange to buy and sell.

00:17.660 --> 00:23.160
People who purchase shares of the company become shareholders and own part of the company.

00:23.160 --> 00:27.600
Shareholders, unless they own a significant percentage of the company's shares, are unlikely

00:27.600 --> 00:31.400
to have any direct say on how the company is run.

00:31.400 --> 00:35.640
But they will be able to attend shareholder meetings where the bosses of the company will

00:35.640 --> 00:39.440
present their strategies and plans for the company going forward.

00:39.440 --> 00:43.760
These meetings are also a place where the bosses are answerable to the shareholders for bad

00:43.760 --> 00:46.720
decisions and poor company performance.

00:46.720 --> 00:51.260
Depending on the perceived value of a company, the price of a share will rise or fall.

00:51.260 --> 00:56.840
If say company X has landed a lucrative government contract, then confidence in company X will

00:56.840 --> 01:00.480
rise and the company's share price is likely to rise.

01:00.480 --> 01:05.240
On the other hand, if company Y suffers a setback during the manufacturing of its product,

01:05.240 --> 01:10.920
confidence in company Y is likely to fall and the company's share price will also fall.

01:10.920 --> 01:16.120
The value of shares fluctuate daily and stockbrokers work the market for their clients, trying

01:16.120 --> 01:20.000
to make a profit for them by buying shares when the prices are low and selling shares

01:20.000 --> 01:22.280
when the prices are high.

01:22.280 --> 01:27.320
In relation to the stock market, you may have heard acronyms and terms used such as FTSE,

01:27.320 --> 01:31.200
NASDAQ, Dow Jones, S&P 500, etc.

01:31.200 --> 01:35.240
These are the names of share indexes and they measure the value of a section of the stock

01:35.240 --> 01:36.240
market.

01:36.240 --> 01:42.340
For example, in the UK, the FTSE 100 is a share index composed of the 100 largest companies

01:42.340 --> 01:44.920
listed on the London Stock Exchange.

01:44.920 --> 01:49.480
These companies are often dubbed blue chip companies and include companies such as Barclay's

01:49.480 --> 01:52.120
EasyJet, Tesco and ITV.

01:52.120 --> 01:57.040
The value of this share index is an indicator of how well the UK's economy is doing as

01:57.040 --> 01:58.040
a whole.

01:58.040 --> 02:00.760
So, that's the stock exchange in a nutshell.

02:00.760 --> 02:05.120
It's a global marketplace where shares and other company securities such as bonds are

02:05.120 --> 02:06.640
bought and sold.

02:06.640 --> 02:10.940
This is obviously a simplified explanation but it should give you a basic understanding

02:10.940 --> 02:14.000
of what the stock exchange is and how it works.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.120
